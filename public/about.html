<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I am Ana and I am at the beginning in this amazing world of Web
  Development.
</p>

<p>
  I've started in a 7 days marathon, where I discovered how much I like coding,
  and after this I started to learn by my self from YouTube lessons and create
  some small Web pages.
</p>

<p>
  In March 2024, I bought "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" course
  from Udemy, by Dr. Angela Yu. Right now I am creating my portfolio using her
  technics.
